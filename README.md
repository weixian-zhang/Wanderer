# Wanderer 

Project Wanderer consist of 1 or more apps to be developed on the fly demostrating concepts of Azure Kubernetes and Microservices without upfront structured architecture design.  
In a way, Wanderer consist of proven micro-software tactics to tackle software architecture design or development puzzles.  
Features of Wanderer can span from: How an App reads a file from mounted Azure  Disk in Kubernetes, to serving APIs through gRPC or App authorization using Rego and Open Policy Agent. There is no feature limit to Wanderer as features grow when I meet new challenges anytime.
